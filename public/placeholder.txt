This directory is for static assets like images, icons, and other files.

For the portfolio, you can add:
- Project screenshots
- Profile pictures
- Icons and logos
- Any other static assets

The components are currently using emoji placeholders, but you can replace them with actual images by updating the image paths in the data/portfolio.ts file.
